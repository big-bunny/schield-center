                    Schield Center is a school located in Kajiado, officially established in 2008 by Patricia Schield,
                    an American woman who made a courageous decision. Patricia sold everything she owned and utilized her
                    inheritance to initiate the school. Tragically, Patricia passed away in 2008 before witnessing her dreams
                    come to fruition. Feeling like she had failed, Patricia`s dying wish to Joseph Mboya was to establish the
                    school through trustees and fundraising efforts.
